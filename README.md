Stochastic Profitability Modeling for Digital Lending (INR)

This project simulates long-term profitability for a portfolio of digital loans using stochastic modeling in Python. It captures real-world uncertainty by factoring in variable interest rates, borrower defaults, and loan segment behaviors.

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

Digital lending platforms face uncertainty in borrower behavior, repayment, and profitability. This simulation models profit/loss outcomes over thousands of loans across different borrower segments (e.g., Retail and MSME) using stochastic variables.

## ðŸ’¡ Key Concepts

- Randomized loan amounts and interest rates (Normal distribution)
- Segment-based default probabilities
- Partial recovery for defaulted loans
- Profit = interest earned (if no default) OR loss due to unrecovered principal

## ðŸ§ª Methodology

- Number of Loans: 10,000
- Segments: Retail (60%), MSME (40%)
- Defaults: Retail â€“ 5%, MSME â€“ 10%
- Recovery rate: 30%
- Interest: Normally distributed, mean = 15%

## ðŸ“Š Outputs

- Average profit per loan (in INR)
- Segment-wise profit distribution
- Histogram of profit across all loans
